# Bug Squashing
## Task
- Fix the problems with the code and construct a list of the things you've fixed (and a brief explanation of the problem) so that the other developer can learn.
## Problems & Their Fix
1. Duplicate import statement (#include <stdio.h>)
2. spelling error (emialAddress)
3. Change the phone data type from Int to LLong to cater for long integers and to avoid potentially overflowing.
