Avoid semantic: giving the methods more meaningful names to easily understand them 
sortPhoneNumber method for loop missing initializing the variables.

Changed the for loop in main() from for (i = 0; i < 50; i++) to for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) to match the allocated size of ss
Moved the allocation of s inside the for loop in main() to create a new instance of s for each iteration
Changed the fscanf() call to remove the address-of operator (&) from the arguments
Changed the allocation size of ss from 100 * sizeof(struct S **) to 100 * sizeof(struct S *) to match the intended type
Changed the comparison operators == in the ffn(), fln(), fem(), and fph() functions to strcmp() to compare strings
Added a break statement at the end of the case 4 block in the switch statement
close the open file with the function fclose()
