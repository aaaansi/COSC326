Coding problems:
Starting small from Makefile
    - Your makefile command does not contain warning flags enabled such as -W and -pedantic can help identify problems when compiling
    - Your build target isnt very descriptive, give your executable a semantic name.

File "Main.c" problems
    - Removed unnecessary use of <math.h> header. removing it means you can also get rid of -lm flag in makefile
    - Removed duplicate #include <stdio.h> statement
    - Avoid using variable names without meaning  for example Struct "S" can be called Struct "Customer" to easily understand its contents better.
    - Changed struct name "S" to ease readability from S to something more meaningful like "Customer"
    - Changed struct to typedef so I can give it a pointer that I can simply declare variables with for example "Customer cust;" instead of "struct Customer *cust;" 
    - Misspelling for words like "emialAddress" to "emailAddress".
    - Changed data type of phone from int to char to avoid overflow and because int removes leading zeros and can only take up to 10 digits
    - Defined the lengths of struct fields. You can do this for example like "#define MAX_FIELD_LEN 256" and then you can use MAX_FIELD_LEN to set the length of the field.
    - Avoid using global variables i, j, and count should be local variables to avoid potential errors if you were to modify them.
    
in the Main()
    - You are calling the fopen(with argv[1]) but when setting the param for main() you didnt set argv to be of type char array.
    - For easier understanding instead of just calling argv[1] we can say filename = argv[1] that way we can just call filename and understand more. 
    - 
    - Looking at the main() program we can see that we are using the methods of sorting the fields by order before we try to search for what the users looking for
      These methods are useless as we can jump straight to searching without the need to sort.

Changed the for loop in main() from for (i = 0; i < 50; i++) to for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) to match the allocated size of ss
Moved the allocation of s inside the for loop in main() to create a new instance of s for each iteration
Changed the fscanf() call to remove the address-of operator (&) from the arguments
Changed the allocation size of ss from 100 * sizeof(struct S **) to 100 * sizeof(struct S *) to match the intended type
Changed the comparison operators == in the ffn(), fln(), fem(), and fph() functions to strcmp() to compare strings
Added a break statement at the end of the case 4 block in the switch statement
close the open file with the function fclose()
changed findPhoneNumber() s parameter from int to char
changed gets(buffer) to fgets(buffer)
