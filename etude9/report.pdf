Removed duplicate #include <stdio.h> statement
Removed unnecessary #include <stdio.h> and #include <string.h> statements
Changed struct name "S" to ease readability from S to something more meaningful like "Customer"
Changed struct to typedef so I can give it a pointer that I can simply declare variables with for example "Customer cust;" instead of "struct Customer *cust;" 
Misspelling for words like "emialAddress" to "emailAddress".
Changed int phone to long phone to avoid overflow
Initialized variables i, j, and count to 0
Changed the for loop in main() from for (i = 0; i < 50; i++) to for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) to match the allocated size of ss
Moved the allocation of s inside the for loop in main() to create a new instance of s for each iteration
Changed the fscanf() call to remove the address-of operator (&) from the arguments
Changed the allocation size of ss from 100 * sizeof(struct S **) to 100 * sizeof(struct S *) to match the intended type
Changed the comparison operators == in the ffn(), fln(), fem(), and fph() functions to strcmp() to compare strings
Added a break statement at the end of the case 4 block in the switch statement
