 # Dates Etude
  * To run the program you can simply run it and input lines of code manually or you can compile it in the terminal using javac and pipe a text file to it in which the inputs are seperated by new lines.
    * for example; 
        - javac checkDate.java
        - java checkDate < 1.in
  * The test files used are also in the same repository folder and were taken from the discord server. most of my own tests were done using basic line input so I will later on add those to a text file.
