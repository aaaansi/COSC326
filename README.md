# COSC326 etudes
COSC326 is a problem solving course that presents a series of exercises, called études, designed to develop your skills as computer scientists. These études are designed to foster both analytical and creative problem-solving skills. I have attached below my solutions to the etudes.

* [Dates](./etude1) - The programs objective is to read a line from input and check if its a valid date between the years 1753 and 3000.

* [Koch Snowflake](./etude3) - The programs objective is to have an interactive program that draws the Koch's Snowflake curve and updates accordingly.

* [Where In the World is CS?](./etude7) - The program reads coordinates from stdin and, where possible, converts them into GeoJSON file to then display on a map.

* [Bug Squashing](./etude9) - Fix the problems with the code and construct a list of the things you’ve fixed (and a
brief explanation of the problem) so that the other developer can learn.
