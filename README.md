# COSC326 etudes
COSC326 is a problem solving course that presents a series of exercises, called études, designed to develop your skills as computer scientists. These études are designed to foster both analytical and creative problem-solving skills. I have attached below my solutions to the etudes.

* [dates](./etude1) - The programs objective is to read a line from input and check if its a valid date between the years 1753 and 3000.
  * To run the program you can simply run it and input lines of code manually or you can compile it in the terminal using javac and pipe a text file to it in which the inputs are seperated by new lines.
    * for example; 
        - javac checkDate.java
        - java checkDate < 1.in
  * The test files used are also in the same repository folder and were taken from the discord server. most of my own tests were done using basic line input so I will later on add those to a text file.
